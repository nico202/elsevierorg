Childhood injury cases were not examined thoroughly from the perspective of how equipment can be modified for improving safety without ruining its attraction to children. To design age-appropriate and safer playground equipment, it is essential that scientific data on the interaction between children and this equipment be accumulated. Herein we report on studies to develop new playground equipment by applying sensor technology to examine the science behind children's interaction with playground equipment. We developed a rock-climbing wall equipped with force sensors to record the physical behavior of children while on the wall, thus allowing measurement of these behaviors in a more natural environment. Fifty force sensors installed in the developed rock-climbing wall are able to collect a large amount of data while children are playing with the equipment. The behavior data of 623 children were recorded in the present study. Herein, we also report on a child behavior prediction model created from the collected data.},

	abstract = {Strokes affect thousands of people worldwide leaving sufferers with severe disabilities affecting their daily activities. In recent years, new rehabilitation techniques have emerged such as constraint-induced therapy, biofeedback therapy and robot-aided therapy. In particular, robotic techniques allow precise recording of movements and application of forces to the affected limb, making it a valuable tool for motor rehabilitation. In addition, robot-aided therapy can utilise visual cues conveyed on a computer screen to convert repetitive movement practice into an engaging task such as a game. Visual cues can also be used to control the information sent to the patient about exercise performance and to potentially address psychosomatic variables influencing therapy. This paper overviews the current state-of-the-art on upper limb robot-mediated therapy with a focal point on the technical requirements of robotic therapy devices leading to the development of upper limb rehabilitation techniques that facilitate reach-to-touch, fine motor control, whole-arm movements and promote rehabilitation beyond hospital stay. The reviewed literature suggest that while there is evidence supporting the use of this technology to reduce functional impairment, besides the technological push, the challenge ahead lies on provision of effective assessment of outcome and modalities that have a stronger impact transferring functional gains into functional independence.},

	abstract = {Research into rehabilitation robotics has grown rapidly and the number of therapeutic rehabilitation robots has expanded dramatically during the last two decades. Robotic rehabilitation therapy can deliver high-dosage and high-intensity training, making it useful for patients with motor disorders caused by stroke or spinal cord disease. Robotic devices used for motor rehabilitation include end-effector and exoskeleton types; herein, we review the clinical use of both types. One application of robot-assisted therapy is improvement of gait function in patients with stroke. Both end-effector and the exoskeleton devices have proven to be effective complements to conventional physiotherapy in patients with subacute stroke, but there is no clear evidence that robotic gait training is superior to conventional physiotherapy in patients with chronic stroke or when delivered alone. In another application, upper limb motor function training in patients recovering from stroke, robot-assisted therapy was comparable or superior to conventional therapy in patients with subacute stroke. With end-effector devices, the intensity of therapy was the most important determinant of upper limb motor recovery. However, there is insufficient evidence for the use of exoskeleton devices for upper limb motor function in patients with stroke. For rehabilitation of hand motor function, either end-effector and exoskeleton devices showed similar or additive effects relative to conventional therapy in patients with chronic stroke. The present evidence supports the use of robot-assisted therapy for improving motor function in stroke patients as an additional therapeutic intervention in combination with the conventional rehabilitation therapies. Nevertheless, there will be substantial opportunities for technical development in near future.},

The model is based on providing a high ranging accuracy (intersensor distance) between a pair of transceivers placed on the adjacent segments of the joint center of rotation. The measured distance is then used to compute the joint angles based on the law of cosines. The performance of the method was compared with a flexible goniometer by simultaneously measuring joint flexion-extension angles at different angular velocities, ranging between 8 and 90°/s. The measurement errors were evaluated by the average differences between two sets of data (ranging from 0.8° for slow movement to 2.8° for fast movement), by standard deviation (ranging from 1.2° to 4.2° for various movement speeds) and by the Pearson correlation coefficient (greater than 0.99) which demonstrates the very good performance of the UWB-based approach. The experimental results have shown that the system has sufficient accuracy for clinical applications, such as rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Background: Gait is often impaired in people after stroke, restricting personal independence and affecting quality of life. During stroke rehabilitation, walking capacity is conventionally assessed by measuring walking distance and speed. Gait features, such as asymmetry and variability, are not routinely determined, but may provide more specific insights into the patient’s walking capacity. Inertial measurement units offer a feasible and promising tool to determine these gait features. Objective: We examined the test–retest reliability of inertial measurement units-based gait features measured in a two-minute walking assessment in people after stroke and while in clinical rehabilitation. Method: Thirty-one people after stroke performed two assessments with a test–retest interval of 24 h. Each assessment consisted of a two-minute walking test on a 14-m walking path. Participants were equipped with three inertial measurement units, placed at both feet and at the low back. In total, 166 gait features were calculated for each assessment, consisting of spatio-temporal (56), frequency (26), complexity (63), and asymmetry (14) features. The reliability was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Additionally, the minimal detectable change and the relative minimal detectable change were computed. Results: Overall, 107 gait features had good–excellent reliability, consisting of 50 spatio-temporal, 8 frequency, 36 complexity, and 13 symmetry features. The relative minimal detectable change of these features ranged between 0.5 and 1.5 standard deviations. Conclusion: Gait can reliably be assessed in people after stroke in clinical stroke rehabilitation using three inertial measurement units.},

This study investigated the classification accuracy of a combined surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer (ACC) sensor system for monitoring activities of daily living in patients with stroke. sEMG and ACC data (eight channels each) were recorded from 10 hemiparetic patients while they carried out a sequence of 11 activities of daily living (identification tasks), and 10 activities used to evaluate misclassification errors (nonidentification tasks). The sEMG and ACC sensor data were analyzed using a multilayered neural network and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system to identify the minimal sensor configuration needed to accurately classify the identification tasks, with a minimal number of misclassifications from the nonidentification tasks. The results demonstrated that the highest sensitivity and specificity for the identification tasks was achieved using a subset of four ACC sensors and adjacent sEMG sensors located on both upper arms, one forearm, and one thigh, respectively. This configuration resulted in a mean sensitivity of 95.0\%, and a mean specificity of 99.7\% for the identification tasks, and a mean misclassification error of {\textless}10\% for the nonidentification tasks.

	abstract = {Chronic wrist impairment is frequent following stroke and negatively impacts everyday life. Rehabilitation of the dysfunctional limb is possible but requires extensive training and motivation. Wearable training devices might offer new opportunities for rehabilitation. However, few devices are available to train wrist extension even though this movement is highly relevant for many upper limb activities of daily living. As a proof of caoncept, we developed the eWrist, a wearable one degree-of-freedom powered exoskeleton which supports wrist extension training. Conceptually one might think of an electric bike which provides mechanical support only when the rider moves the pedals, i.e. it enhances motor activity but does not replace it. Stroke patients may not have the ability to produce overt movements, but they might still be able to produce weak muscle activation that can be measured via surface electromyography (sEMG). By combining force and sEMG-based control in an assist-as-needed support strategy, we aim at providing a training device which enhances activity of the wrist extensor muscles in the context of daily life activities, thereby, driving cortical reorganization and recovery. Preliminary results show that the integration of sEMG signals in the control strategy allow for adjustable assistance with respect to a proxy measurement of corticomotor drive.},

The primary outcome was the success rate of the implementation of the sEMG-based assessment. The number of dropouts and the motivations have been registered. A detailed report on difficulties in implementing the sEMG protocol has been edited for each patient. The educational level and the working status of the staff have been registered. Each member of staff completed a brief survey indicating their level of knowledge of sEMG, using a five-point Likert scale.Results: The sEMG protocol was carried out by a multidisciplinary team composed of Physical Therapists (PTs) and Biomedical Engineers (BEs). Indeed, the educational level and the expertise of the members of staff influenced the fulfillment of the implementation of the study. The PTs involved in the study did not receive any formal education on sEMG during their course of study. The low success rate (22.7\%) of the protocol was caused by several factors which could be grouped in: patient-related barriers; cultural barriers; technical barriers; and administrative barriers.Conclusions: Since a series of barriers limited the use of sEMG in the clinical rehabilitative environment, concrete actions are needed for disseminating sEMG in rehabilitation services.

However, translation of these technologies to the clinic would need further research to increase ease of use and improve clinical validity of the outcomes of these technologies.
Discussion
The current review discusses the limitations of the interactive wearable technologies such as, limited clinical utility, bulky equipment, difficulty in setting up equipment inertial motion sensors and e-textiles.
Conclusion
There is tremendous potential for interactive wearable technologies in rehabilitation. With the evolution of cloud computing, interactive wearable systems can remotely provide intervention and monitor patient progress using models of telerehabilitation. This will revolutionize the delivery of rehabilitation and make rehabilitation more accessible and affordable to millions of individuals.},

Firstly, an introduction of the key gait parameters and semi-subjective methods is presented. Secondly, technologies and studies on the different objective methods are reviewed. Finally, based on the latest research, the characteristics of each method are discussed. 40\% of the reviewed articles published in late 2012 and 2013 were related to non-wearable systems, 37.5\% presented inertial sensor-based systems, and the remaining 22.5\% corresponded to other wearable systems. An increasing number of research works demonstrate that various parameters such as precision, conformability, usability or transportability have indicated that the portable systems based on body sensors are promising methods for gait analysis.},

	abstract = {Background
The use of virtual reality systems in the motor rehabilitation of children with cerebral palsy is new, and thus the scientific evidence for its effectiveness needs to be evaluated through a systematic review.
Objective
To provide updated evidence-based guidance for virtual reality rehabilitation in sensory and functional motor skills of children and adolescents with cerebral palsy.
Data sources
PubMed, PEDro, Web of Science, OTseeker, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library were searched from their earliest records up to 1 June, 2016.
Study selection
Two reviewers applied the population intervention comparison outcome (PICO) question to screen the studies for this review.
Data extraction
Information on study design, subjects, intervention, outcome measures and efficacy results were extracted into a pilot-tested form. Method quality was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Downs and Black checklist.
Data synthesis
Thirty-one studies included 369 participants in total. Best evidence synthesis was applied to summarize the outcomes, which were grouped according to International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. Moderate evidence was found for balance and overall motor development. The evidence is still limited for other motor skills.
Conclusions
This review uncovered additional literature showing moderate evidence that virtual reality rehabilitation is a promising intervention to improve balance and motor skills in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy. The technique is growing, so long-term follow-up and further research are required to determine its exact place in the management of cerebral palsy.

This study aims to review the effect of AR technology in the recovery of the upper and lower limb function in stroke patients. Published randomized controlled trials and observational investigations with adult stroke patients were retrieved from five electronic databases to analyze the effect of the AR systems in improving motor function and balance and gait function for stroke patients. The treatment effect was estimated by standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) using a random effect model for motor function outcomes at the body structure and function, body activity and participation level of the International Classification of Functioning, and balance and gait outcomes. In total, 13 investigations (9 for the upper limb and 4 for the lower limb) were identified. AR demonstrated a significant influence on the upper limb function (SMD = 0.657; 95\% CI, 0.287 to 1.026; p = 0.000) and the lower limb function (SMD = 0.52; 95\% CI, 0.039 to 1.001; p = 0.034). The present analysis suggests that AR applications could offer options for increasing treatment intensity and promoting motor recovery after a stroke. This approach can be used with the conventional rehabilitation methods as a new intervention for recovering upper and lower limb function.},

Data from different databases were searched from inception until October 2020. Studies that investigated the effects of immersive VR interventions on post-stroke adult subjects via a head-mounted display (HMD) were included. These studies included a control group that received conventional therapy or another non-immersive VR intervention. The studies reported statistical data for the groups involved in at least the posttest as well as relevant outcomes measuring functional or motor recovery of either lower or upper limbs. Most of the studies found significant improvements in some outcomes after the intervention in favor of the virtual rehabilitation group. Although evidence is limited, immersive VR therapies constitute an interesting tool to improve motor learning when used in conjunction with traditional rehabilitation therapies, providing a non-pharmacological therapeutic pathway for people after stroke.},

The first part introduces the reader to VR's state-of-the-art as well as future trends. In the next section, leading research scientists discuss how knowledge of communication can be used to build more effective and exciting communication applications of virtual reality. Looking ahead, the authors explore pioneering approaches to VR narratives, interpersonal communication, the use of 3D sound, and the building of VR entertainment complexes. In the final section, the authors zoom out to view the big picture -- the psychological, social, and cultural implications of virtual reality. Thought-provoking discussions consider important communication issues such as:  * How will virtual reality influence perception of reality?  * What are the legal issues defining communication in virtual reality?  * What kind of cultural trends will this technology encourage?},

To reach this target, a patients’ activities need to be continuously monitored, and subsequently corrected.

Though many studies have attempted to reduce the discomfort, they produced conflicting results with varying degrees of VR sickness. In particular, a visually improved VR does not necessarily result in decreased VR sickness. To understand these unexpected results, we surveyed the causes of VR sickness and measurement of symptoms. We reorganized the causes of the VR sickness into three major factors (hardware, content, and human factors) and investigated the sub-component of each factor. We then surveyed frequently used measures of VR sickness, both subjective and objective approaches. We also investigated emerging approaches for reducing VR sickness and proposed a multimodal fidelity hypothesis to give an insight into future studies.},

Of particular interest here are two sets of experimental observations: 1) cortical influences appear essential for multisensory integration in the SC, and 2) postnatal experience guides its maturation. The current belief is that the experience normally gained during early life is instantiated in the cortico-SC projection, and that this is the primary route by which ecological pressures adapt SC multisensory integration to the particular environment in which it will be used.},

However, discussion of the way to most effectively provide augmented feedback has been controversial. Related studies have focused primarily on simple or artificial tasks enhanced by visual feedback. Recently, technical advances have made it possible also to investigate more complex, realistic motor tasks and to implement not only visual, but also auditory, haptic, or multimodal augmented feedback. The aim of this review is to address the potential of augmented unimodal and multimodal feedback in the framework of motor learning theories. The review addresses the reasons for the different impacts of feedback strategies within or between the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and the challenges that need to be overcome to provide appropriate feedback in these modalities, either in isolation or in combination. Accordingly, the design criteria for successful visual, auditory, haptic, and multimodal feedback are elaborated.},

The task involved Tri-Dimensional Chess, and required subjects to reproduce on a real chess board the state of board learned from a sequence of moves witnessed in a virtual environment. Twenty four subjects were allocated to a factorial design consisting of two levels of immersion (exocentric screen based, and egocentric HMD based), and two kinds of environment (plain and realistic). The results suggest that egocentric subjects performed better than exocentric, and those in the more realistic environment performed better than those in the less realistic environment. Previous knowledge of chess, and amount of virtual practice were also significant, and may be considered as control variables to equalise these factors amongst the subjects. Other things being equal, males remembered the moves better than females, although female performance improved with higher spatial ability test score. The paper also attempts to clarify the relationship between immersion, presence and performance, and locates the experiment within such a theoretical framework.},

	abstract = {Background Rehabilitative stroke interventions based on principles of multimodal stimulation have the potential to profoundly affect neuroplastic processes beyond the sub-acute phase. In order to identify important core mechanisms, there is a need to explore how interventions that combine physical, social, sensory, and cognitively challenging activities are perceived and experienced by the participants. This qualitative study, based on an interpretive interactionist perspective, explored the experiences of stroke survivors who participated in a group-based multimodal rehabilitation program based on rhythm and music. Methods and findings Within four weeks after completion of the multimodal rehabilitation program, face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted on a single occasion with 15 purposively selected individuals (mean age 65, 8 men, 7 women). The interview duration was between 13 and 44 minutes. Qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach was used to analyze data. Three categories were identified, each containing several sub-categories: To be intellectually challenged (energy-consuming activity and coordinating multiple input and output), Perceived therapeutic benefits (motor skills, cognitive skills, emotional and psychological responses), and Pros and cons with social integration (fellowship, competing with others, and instructor characteristics). From these categories, an overall theme was derived: The multifaceted layers of multimodal stimulation. Enjoying music, being part of a group with peers, a skilled instructor, and being able to manage the challenging movements, were related to positive experiences. In contrast, negative experiences were associated with not being able to perform the exercises, and with group members who dominated the conversational space. Conclusion This study shows that access to a multimodal rehabilitation program with rhythm and music as operating ingredients may contribute to positive experiences for many individuals in a late phase after stroke in terms of motor, cognitive, as well as emotional enhancements. Important components were the music, the social interaction, the challenging exercises, and the skilled instructor.},

Results from neurophysiological and neuroanatomical experiments in animals and noninvasive neuroimaging and electrophysiological studies in humans show considerable plasticity of motor representations with use or nonuse, skill learning, or injury to the nervous system. An important concept of reorganization in the motor cortex is that of a distributed neuronal network in which multiple overlapping motor representations are functionally connected through an extensive horizontal network. By changing the strength of horizontal connections between motor neurons, functionally different neuronal assemblies can form, thereby providing a substrate to construct dynamic motor output zones. Modulation of inhibition and synaptic efficacy are mechanisms involved. Recent evidence from animal experiments indicates that these functional changes are accompanied by anatomical changes. Because plasticity of the brain plays a major role in the recovery of function after stroke, the knowledge of the principles of plasticity may help to design strategies to enhance plasticity when it is beneficial, such as after brain infarction.},

	abstract = {Purpose—
              Much has transpired since the last scientific statement on pediatric stroke was published 10 years ago. Although stroke has long been recognized as an adult health problem causing substantial morbidity and mortality, it is also an important cause of acquired brain injury in young patients, occurring most commonly in the neonate and throughout childhood. This scientific statement represents a synthesis of data and a consensus of the leading experts in childhood cardiovascular disease and stroke.
            
            
              Methods—
              Members of the writing group were appointed by the American Heart Association Stroke Council’s Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the American Heart Association’s Manuscript Oversight Committee and were chosen to reflect the expertise of the subject matter. The writers used systematic literature reviews, references to published clinical and epidemiology studies, morbidity and mortality reports, clinical and public health guidelines, authoritative statements, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence and to indicate gaps in current knowledge. This scientific statement is based on expert consensus considerations for clinical practice.
            
            
              Results—
              Annualized pediatric stroke incidence rates, including both neonatal and later childhood stroke and both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, range from 3 to 25 per 100 000 children in developed countries. Newborns have the highest risk ratio: 1 in 4000 live births. Stroke is a clinical syndrome. Delays in diagnosis are common in both perinatal and childhood stroke but for different reasons. To develop new strategies for prevention and treatment, disease processes and risk factors that lead to pediatric stroke are discussed here to aid the clinician in rapid diagnosis and treatment. The many important differences that affect the pathophysiology and treatment of childhood stroke are discussed in each section.
            
            
              Conclusions—
              Here we provide updates on perinatal and childhood stroke with a focus on the subtypes, including arterial ischemic, venous thrombotic, and hemorrhagic stroke, and updates in regard to areas of childhood stroke that have not received close attention such as sickle cell disease. Each section is highlighted with considerations for clinical practice, attendant controversies, and knowledge gaps. This statement provides the practicing provider with much-needed updated information in this field.},

	abstract = {Stroke can occur at any age or stage in life. Although it is commonly thought of as a disease amongst the elderly, it is important to highlight the fact that it also affects infants and children. In both populations, strokes have a high rate of morbidity and mortality. Arguably, it is more detrimental in the pediatric population given the occurrence at a younger age and therefore, a longer duration of disability, potentially over the entire lifespan. The high rate of morbidity and mortality in pediatrics is attributed to significant delays in diagnosis, as well as misdiagnosis. Acute stroke management is time dependent. Patients who receive acute treatment with either intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or mechanical thrombectomy, have improved mortality and functional outcomes. Additionally, the earlier treatment is initiated, the higher the likelihood of preserving penumbra, restoring cerebral blood flow and potentially reversing symptoms, thereby limiting disability. Prompt identification is essential as it leads to improved patient care in such a narrow therapeutic window. It enhances the care received during hospitalization and reduces the risk of early stroke recurrence. Despite limited data and lack of large randomized clinical trials in pediatrics, both IV tPA and mechanical thrombectomy have been successfully used. Bridging the gap of acute stroke management in the pediatric population is an essential part of minimizing adverse outcomes. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of pediatric stroke, the diverse etiologies, presentation as well as both acute and preventative management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: While sensory dysfunction is common in children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy (CP) secondary to perinatal stroke, it is an understudied contributor to disability with limited objective measurement tools. Robotic technology offers the potential to objectively measure complex sensorimotor function but has been understudied in perinatal stroke. The present study aimed to quantify kinesthetic deficits in hemiparetic children with perinatal stroke and determine their association with clinical function.
METHODS: Case-control study. Participants were 6-19 years of age. Stroke participants had MRI confirmed unilateral perinatal arterial ischemic stroke or periventricular venous infarction, and symptomatic hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Participants completed a robotic assessment of upper extremity kinesthesia using a robotic exoskeleton (KINARM). Four kinesthetic parameters (response latency, initial direction error, peak speed ratio, and path length ratio) and their variabilities were measured with and without vision. Robotic outcomes were compared across stroke groups and controls and to clinical measures of sensorimotor function.
RESULTS: Forty-three stroke participants (23 arterial, 20 venous, median age 12 years, 42\% female) were compared to 106 healthy controls. Stroke cases displayed significantly impaired kinesthesia that remained when vision was restored. Kinesthesia was more impaired in arterial versus venous lesions and correlated with clinical measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic assessment of kinesthesia is feasible in children with perinatal stroke. Kinesthetic impairment is common and associated with stroke type. Failure to correct with vision suggests sensory network dysfunction.},

	abstract = {In the last decade, virtual reality (VR) training has been used extensively in video games and military training to provide a sense of realism and environmental interaction to its users. More recently, VR training has been explored as a possible adjunct therapy for people with motor and mental health dysfunctions. The concept underlying VR therapy as a treatment for motor and cognitive dysfunction is to improve neuroplasticity of the brain by engaging users in multisensory training. In this review, we discuss the theoretical framework underlying the use of VR as a therapeutic intervention for neurorehabilitation and provide evidence for its use in treating motor and mental disorders such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, stroke, schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, and other related clinical areas. While this review provides some insights into the efficacy of VR in clinical rehabilitation and its complimentary use with neuroimaging (e.g., fNIRS and EEG) and neuromodulation (e.g., tDCS and rTMS), more research is needed to understand how different clinical conditions are affected by VR therapies (e.g., stimulus presentation, interactivity, control and types of VR). Future studies should consider large, longitudinal randomized controlled trials to determine the true potential of VR therapies in various clinical populations.},

	abstract = {Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most frequent causes of child disability in developed countries. Children with CP need lifelong assistance and care. The current prevalence of CP in industrialized countries ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 per 1,000 live births, with one new case every 500 live births. Children with CP have an almost normal life expectancy and mortality is very low. Despite the low mortality rate, 5\%-10\% of them die during childhood, especially when the severe motor disability is comorbid with epilepsy and severe intellectual disability. Given this life expectancy, children with CP present with a lifelong disability of varying severity and complexity, which requires individualized pathways of care. There are no specific treatments that can remediate the brain damage responsible for the complex clinical-functional dysfunctions typical of CP. There are, however, a number of interventions (eg, neurorehabilitation, functional orthopedic surgery, medication, etc) aimed at limiting the damage secondary to the brain insult and improving these patients' activity level and participation and, therefore, their quality of life. The extreme variability of clinical aspects and the complexity of affected functions determine a multifaceted skill development in children with CP. There is a need to provide them with long-term care, taking into account medical and social aspects as well as rehabilitation, education, and assistance. This long-term care must be suited according to children's developmental stage and their physical, psychological, and social development within their life contexts. This impacts heavily on the national health systems which must set up a network of services for children with CP, and it also impacts heavily on the family as a whole, due to the resulting distress, adjustment efforts, and changes in quality of life. This contribution is a narrative review of the current literature on long-term care for children with CP, aiming at suggesting reflections to improve these children's care.},

	abstract = {Cognitive Multisensory Rehabilitation (CMR) is a promising therapy for upper limb recovery in stroke, but the brain mechanisms are unknown. We previously demonstrated that the parietal operculum (parts OP1/OP4) is activated with CMR exercises. In this exploratory study, we assessed the baseline difference between OP1/OP4 functional connectivity (FC) at rest in stroke versus healthy adults to then explore whether CMR affects OP1/OP4 connectivity and sensorimotor recovery after stroke. We recruited 8 adults with chronic stroke and left hemiplegia/paresis and 22 healthy adults. Resting-state FC with the OP1/OP4 region-of-interest in the affected hemisphere was analysed before and after 6 weeks of CMR. We evaluated sensorimotor function and activities of daily life pre- and post-CMR, and at 1-year post-CMR. At baseline, we found decreased FC between the right OP1/OP4 and 34 areas distributed across all lobes in stroke versus healthy adults. After CMR, only four areas had decreased FC compared to healthy adults. Compared to baseline (pre-CMR), participants improved on motor function (MESUPES arm p = 0.02; MESUPES hand p = 0.03; MESUPES total score p = 0.006); on stereognosis (p = 0.03); and on the Frenchay Activities Index (p = 0.03) at post-CMR and at 1-year follow-up. These results suggest enhanced sensorimotor recovery post-stroke after CMR. Our results justify larger-scale studies.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this article is to describe theoretical and research bases for constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), to discuss key features and variations in protocols currently in use with children, and to review the results of studies of efficacy. CIMT has been found to be an effective intervention for increasing functional use of the hemiparetic upper extremity in adults with chronic disability from stroke. CIMT developed out of behavioral research on the phenomenon of "learned nonuse" of an upper extremity, commonly observed following sensory and/or motor CNS injury, in which failure to regain use persists even after a period of partial recovery. CIMT includes three key elements: (1) constraining the use of the less-impaired upper extremity (UE); (2) intensive, repetitive daily therapist-directed practice of motor movements with the impaired UE for an extended period (2-3 weeks); and (3) shaping of more complex action patterns through a process of rewarding successive approximations to the target action. Mechanisms responsible for success are thought to be separate but complementary, that is, operant conditioning (reversal of learned nonuse) and experience-driven cortical reorganization. CIMT has recently been extended to children with hemiparesis secondary to perinatal stroke or other CNS pathology. Numerous case studies, as well as a small number of randomized controlled or controlled clinical trials have reported substantial gains in functional use of the hemiplegic UE following CIMT with children. Protocols vary widely in terms of type of constraint used, intensity and duration of training, and outcome measures. In general, all report gains in functional use, with minimal or no adverse effects. Continued research is needed, to clarify optimal protocol parameters and to further understand mechanisms of efficacy.},

	abstract = {Constraint-induced (CI) movement therapy is a physical intervention that has been receiving increasing attention in pediatric rehabilitation. So far, the evidence suggests that practice associated with CI therapy may improve impaired unimanual hand function in some children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). However, CI therapy has several important limitations. Most importantly, children with hemiplegia have impairments in bimanual coordination beyond their unilateral impairments. Thus, an intervention approach to increase functional independence during activities of daily living by using both hands in cooperation is needed. Here we briefly review the etiology of hemiplegic CP, describe studies of pediatric CI therapy efficacy in relation to the etiology, discuss the conceptual and practical limitations of CI therapy for this population, and describe bimanual coordination impairments in children with hemiplegia. Finally, we introduce a new intervention for children with hemiplegia, hand-arm bimanual intensive training (HABIT), to address the limitations of CI therapy and to improve bimanual coordination. HABIT retains the two major elements of pediatric CI therapy (intensive structured practice and child-friendliness). The proposed methodology demonstrates that extensive targeted practice can be provided in a child-friendly manner without using a physical restraint, although the efficacy of such an approach remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To clarify whether modified constraint-induced movement therapy provides greater improvement than intensive bimanual training both for motor functions and spontaneous use of the paretic arm and hand in everyday life activities.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled, single-blind trial.
SETTING: Inpatient paediatric rehabilitation clinic.
SUBJECTS: Forty-seven children with unilateral cerebral palsy or other non-progressive hemiplegia (aged 3.3-11.4 years) were randomly assigned to either a modified constraint-induced movement programme (kid-CIMT) or intensive bimanual training.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the kid-CIMT group received 60 hours of unilateral constraint-induced and 20 hours of bimanual training over four weeks. Patients in the bimanual treatment group received 80 hours of bimanual training over four weeks.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Melbourne Assessment of Unilateral Upper Limb Function and Assisting Hand Assessment.
RESULTS: Modified constraint-induced therapy provided a significantly better outcome for isolated motor functions of the paretic arm than bimanual training (gain in Melbourne Assessment, percent score: 6.6 vs. 2.3, P= 0.033). Regarding spontaneous use both methods led to similar improvement (gain in Assisting Hand Assessment, percent score: 6.2 vs. 4.6, P= 0.579). More-disabled children showed greater improvement than less-disabled ones (correlation with Assisting Hand Assessment pretreatment score r = -0.40). Age did not affect treatment outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Modified constraint-induced movement therapy can improve isolated functions of the hemiplegic arm better than intensive bimanual training, but regarding spontaneous hand use in everyday life both methods lead to similar improvement. Improvements are generally greater in more impaired children. Age does not affect outcome.},

	abstract = {AIM: Stroke in children occurs across different phases of brain development. Age at onset may affect outcome and health-related quality of life (HRQL). We evaluated the influence of age at stroke onset on the long-term neurological outcomes and HRQL of pediatric stroke survivors.
METHOD: Children with ischemic stroke were recruited into three groups according to their age at onset of stroke (presumed perinatal, neonatal, and childhood). Neurological outcomes were assessed using the Pediatric Stroke Recovery and Recurrence Questionnaire. HRQL was evaluated using proxy report versions (2-18y) of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL 4.0). A χ(2) /Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed for the neurological outcomes. HRQL scores from the different age groups were compared using linear regression.
RESULTS: Ninety participants (presumed perinatal stroke, n=31; neonatal stroke, n=36; childhood stroke, n=23) were enrolled. Median age at the onset of stroke was 0.5 days and 3.7 years in neonatal and childhood participants respectively. Of the three groups, participants with presumed perinatal stroke demonstrated the worst global (p{\textless}0.002) and motor (p{\textless}0.001) outcomes and the lowest level of independence in daily activities (p{\textless}0.001). Parents reported the best global outcome and overall HRQL (p=0.007) after neonatal stroke.
INTERPRETATION: The age at stroke onset has important implications regarding long-term clinical outcomes and HRQL for survivors. Individuals with presumed perinatal stroke should be considered at high-risk for poor outcomes.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The past 20 years have seen a 35\% increase in prevalence of pediatric stroke. Contrary to widely held views, children do not recover better than adults. This review explores the impact of pediatric stroke on cognitive domains, including intellectual and executive functions, memory and behavior, and the influence of age, lesion characteristics, and comorbidities on outcome.
RECENT FINDINGS: Cognitive problems occur in up to half of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke survivors. Single-center studies have shown intelligence quotient scores skewed to the lower end of the average range, with greater impairment in performance than verbal domains. Executive function, such as attention and processing speed are particularly vulnerable to the effects of pediatric stroke. Age at stroke, larger infarct size, cortical/subcortical lesion location, epilepsy, and comorbid physical deficits are associated with poorer cognitive outcomes.
SUMMARY: Cognitive impairment occurs relatively frequently following pediatric stroke but the nature, severity, and predictors of specific deficits are not well defined. Improving understanding of outcomes following pediatric stroke is a key priority for families but a paucity of data limits the ability to develop targeted disease, and age-specific pediatric rehabilitation strategies to optimize cognitive outcomes following pediatric stroke.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unilateral cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition that affects muscle control and function on one side of the body. Children with unilateral CP experience difficulties using their hands together secondary to disturbances that occur in the developing fetal or infant brain. Often, the more affected limb is disregarded. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) aims to increase use of the more affected upper limb and improve bimanual performance. CIMT is based on two principles: restraining the use of the less affected limb (for example, using a splint, mitt or sling) and intensive therapeutic practice of the more affected limb.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) in the treatment of the more affected upper limb in children with unilateral CP.
SEARCH METHODS: In March 2018 we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PEDro, OTseeker, five other databases and three trials registers. We also ran citation searches, checked reference lists, contacted experts, handsearched key journals and searched using Google Scholar.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs or clinically controlled trials implemented with children with unilateral CP, aged between 0 and 19 years, where CIMT was compared with a different form of CIMT, or a low dose, high-dose or dose-matched alternative form of upper-limb intervention such as bimanual intervention. Primarily, outcomes were bimanual performance, unimanual capacity and manual ability. Secondary outcomes included measures of self-care, body function, participation and quality of life.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts to eliminate ineligible studies. Five review authors were paired to extract data and assess risk of bias in each included study. GRADE assessments were undertaken by two review authors.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 36 trials (1264 participants), published between 2004 and 2018. Sample sizes ranged from 11 to 105 (mean 35). Mean age was 5.96 years (standard deviation (SD) 1.82), range three months to 19.8 years; 53\% male and 47\% participants had left hemiplegia. Fifty-seven outcome measures were used across studies. Average length of CIMT programs was four weeks (range one to 10 weeks). Frequency of sessions ranged from twice weekly to seven days per week. Duration of intervention sessions ranged from 0.5 to eight hours per day. The mean total number of hours of CIMT provided was 137 hours (range 20 to 504 hours). The most common constraint devices were a mitt/glove or a sling (11 studies each).We judged the risk of bias as moderate to high across the studies.
KEY RESULTS: Primary outcomes at primary endpoint (immediately after intervention)CIMT versus low-dose comparison (e.g. occupational therapy)We found low-quality evidence that CIMT was more effective than a low-dose comparison for improving bimanual performance (mean difference (MD) 5.44 Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) units, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.37 to 8.51).CIMT was more effective than a low-dose comparison for improving unimanual capacity (Quality of upper extremity skills test (QUEST) - Dissociated movement MD 5.95, 95\% CI 2.02 to 9.87; Grasps; MD 7.57, 95\% CI 2.10 to 13.05; Weight bearing MD 5.92, 95\% CI 2.21 to 9.6; Protective extension MD 12.54, 95\% CI 8.60 to 16.47). Three studies reported adverse events, including frustration, constraint refusal and reversible skin irritations from casting.CIMT versus high-dose comparison (e.g. individualised occupational therapy, bimanual therapy)When compared with a high-dose comparison, CIMT was not more effective for improving bimanual performance (MD -0.39 AHA Units, 95\% CI -3.14 to 2.36). There was no evidence that CIMT was more effective than a high-dose comparison for improving unimanual capacity in a single study using QUEST (Dissociated movement MD 0.49, 95\% CI -10.71 to 11.69; Grasp MD -0.20, 95\% CI -11.84 to 11.44). Two studies reported that some children experienced frustration participating in CIMT.CIMT versus dose-matched comparison (e.g. Hand Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy, bimanual therapy, occupational therapy)There was no evidence of differences in bimanual performance between groups receiving CIMT or a dose-matched comparison (MD 0.80 AHA units, 95\% CI -0.78 to 2.38).There was no evidence that CIMT was more effective than a dose-matched comparison for improving unimanual capacity (Box and Blocks Test MD 1.11, 95\% CI -0.06 to 2.28; Melbourne Assessment MD 1.48, 95\% CI -0.49 to 3.44; QUEST Dissociated movement MD 6.51, 95\% CI -0.74 to 13.76; Grasp, MD 6.63, 95\% CI -2.38 to 15.65; Weightbearing MD -2.31, 95\% CI -8.02 to 3.40) except for the Protective extension domain (MD 6.86, 95\% CI 0.14 to 13.58).There was no evidence of differences in manual ability between groups receiving CIMT or a dose-matched comparison (ABILHAND-Kids MD 0.74, 95\% CI 0.31 to 1.18). From 15 studies, two children did not tolerate CIMT and three experienced difficulty.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The quality of evidence for all conclusions was low to very low. For children with unilateral CP, there was some evidence that CIMT resulted in improved bimanual performance and unimanual capacity when compared to a low-dose comparison, but not when compared to a high-dose or dose-matched comparison. Based on the evidence available, CIMT appears to be safe for children with CP.},

Neonatal ischemic stroke includes perinatal arterial ischemic stroke, presumed pre- or perinatal stroke, and cerebral sinovenous thrombosis, all of which have emerged as important contributors to cerebral palsy. Of increasing interest is how the overlapping list of associations and risks for stroke and cerebral palsy relate to each other. Stroke-induced injury is focal, and the preservation of normal areas of brain may afford unique opportunities for plastic adaptation. The implications of this essential difference are stressed in a discussion of how the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic advancements in perinatal stroke relate to the outcome of cerebral palsy.},

However, our understanding of how the motor system develops following such early unilateral brain injury is increasing. Tools such as neuroimaging and brain stimulation are generating informed maps of the unique motor networks that emerge following perinatal stroke. As a focal injury of defined timing in an otherwise healthy brain, perinatal stroke represents an ideal human model of developmental plasticity. Here, we provide an introduction to perinatal stroke epidemiology and outcomes, before reviewing models of developmental plasticity after perinatal stroke. We then examine existing therapeutic approaches, including constraint, bimanual and other occupational therapies, and their potential synergy with non-invasive neurostimulation. We end by discussing the promise of exciting new therapies, including novel neurostimulation, brain-computer interfaces and robotics, all focused on improving outcomes after perinatal stroke.},

	abstract = {The aim of this review was to evaluate the evidence for nonpharmacological rehabilitation interventions for motor and cognitive impairment following pediatric stroke. A literature search was conducted using multiple scientific databases. Studies were included if (1) the study population was {\textgreater} 50\% pediatric ({\textless} 18 years) stroke, (2) a diagnosis of stroke was explicitly stated, (3) there were ≥ 3 pediatric stroke participants included in the study sample, and (4) motor or cognitive outcome measures were used to assess effect of treatment. Levels of evidence were assigned to each study to determine the strength of the evidence for each intervention. A total of 18 articles met inclusion criteria. Most studies (N = 14) examined rehabilitation of the upper limb, with constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) as the most common intervention. Overall, the evidence supports the use of CIMT, forced use therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, functional electrical stimulation, and robotics, but suggests no beneficial effect of transcranial direct current stimulation. Very few studies assessed interventions for the lower limb (N = 1) or cognitive impairment (N = 3).Conclusion: Effective rehabilitation approaches are important for optimizing outcomes in children who have had a stroke. Although the number of published clinical trials has increased in recent years, little evidence-based guidance exists for this clinical population. What is Known: • Pediatric stroke is a significant cause of disability in children that is often associated with long-term motor and cognitive sequelae. • There is a need to establish a knowledge base regarding available evidence-based rehabilitation therapies for this clinical population. What is New: • Most studies examining interventions for motor function focus on upper limb rehabilitation, whereas few studies have investigated interventions for improving lower limb or cognitive impairment. • An important gap exists regarding evidence-based rehabilitative treatment approaches for pediatric stroke.},

This retrospective study explored the possible impact of baby constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT) on hand function at two years of age. We hypothesized that baby-CIMT in the first year of life would lead to better bimanual hand use at two years of age than would not receiving baby-CIMT. The Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA) was administered at age 21 months (SD 2.4 months) in 72 children with unilateral CP, 31 of who received baby-CIMT. When dividing the children into four functional levels based on AHA, the proportional distribution differed between the groups in favour of baby-CIMT. Logistic regression analysis indicated that children in the baby-CIMT group were more likely than were children in the no baby-CIMT group to have a high functional level, even when controlling for the effect of brain lesion type (OR 5.83, 95\% CI 1.44-23.56, p = 0.001). However, no difference was found between groups in the odds of having a very low functional level (OR 0.31, 95\% CI 0.08-1.17, p = 0.084). The result shows that baby-CIMT at early age can have a positive effect. Children who received baby-CIMT were six times more likely to have a high functional level at two years of age than were children in the no baby-CIMT group.},

	abstract = {In the vast majority of prehension experiments, subjects are requested to grasp a static object and to transport it with respect to the body. There are grasping tasks, however, that have different grasping requirements. For example, in rock climbing, the goal is to grasp a hold to transport the body about the grasped object. Unlike simple reaching and grasping movements, the successful hand grip is not the goal of the task per se, and it is the postural stability that primarily determines the success or failure of the task. In the present experiment, we wanted to examine the influence of such postural constraints on the organization of reaching movements. Four expert climbers participated in the study. A climbing simulator, equipped with strain gauges, measured the vertical forces applied by the hands. The subjects performed grasping movements (one-reach and two-reach conditions) towards holds of various depths (easy and difficult holds) in two different postures (standing and climbing conditions). The results showed that the duration of the right-hand transport phase was similar whatever the condition. Unexpectedly, in the climbing condition, the duration of the left-hand transport phase was shorter when the subjects grasped a difficult than when they grasped an easy hold. This result suggests that, in extreme cases such as rock climbing, the postural constraints may prevail over accuracy constraints, since increasing accuracy requirements did not yield an increased duration of the transport phase.},

METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, PEDro, OTseeker and SportDiscus for randomized controlled trials published up to December 26, 2010. We included all trials assessing patient-relevant outcomes. Two reviewers independently selected relevant studies, assessed their methodological quality and extracted data. Quality of evidence was rated using the GRADE system. Data were entered into RevMan 5 to calculate effect sizes and 95\% confidence intervals where appropriate.
RESULTS: Eligible for inclusion were four RCTs studying the effectiveness of climbing in (a) geriatric patients, (b) adults with multiple sclerosis, (c) adults with chronic low-back pain and (d) children with disabilities and poor motor function. The sample sizes ranged between 20 and 95. All trials had major methodological limitations. We found very low quality evidence that therapeutic climbing may improve activities of daily living in geriatric patients compared to physiotherapy as measured by the Barthel index (difference in mean change score: 2.32 [95\%-CI: 0.45 to 4.19]). We found very low quality evidence that therapeutic climbing compared to standard exercise therapy may improve physical functioning (difference in mean change score: 16.15 [95\%-CI: 4.45 to 27.85]) and general physical health (13.14 [95\%-CI: 3.61 to 22.67]) as measured by the SF-36 in adults with chronic low back-pain.
CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for the effectiveness of therapeutic climbing is limited to small trials at high risk of bias. The effects of therapeutic climbing are therefore unclear.},

Vestibular rehabilitation (VR) is effective for treating dizziness among various conditions, but the effect of dizziness with origin in the central nervous system is poorly studied.This pilot study of a randomized controlled trial aimed at investigating a vestibular rehabilitation programme among patients with first time stroke and concomitant dizziness. A second aim was to study the feasibility of performing the randomized controlled trial.
METHODS: The participants were computer generated randomized to either an intervention or a control group. The intervention comprised of four different vestibular rehabilitation exercises, adapted for each patient and usual rehabilitation. The control group received usual rehabilitation without the vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Outcome measures used were The Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, the Berg Balance Scale, the Functional Gait Assessment Scale and the EuroQol-5D. Feasibility was studied in terms of recruitment, adherence and retention rates, also as the ability to collect primary and secondary outcomes as well as to find indications of treatment differences.
RESULTS: Self-rated health improved for all participants. No other differences between baseline and follow-up were detected neither within nor between groups. Recruitment rate was 23\%, adherence to the intervention 90\%, retention rate 69\% and ability to collect outcome measures 90\%. No adverse events occurred.
CONCLUSION: Both the intervention and the control groups improved in self-perceived health. The measures of feasibility were satisfactory in this study, apart from a low recruitment rate.},

RESULTS: Typically developing youths engaged in a broader range of activities and did so more frequently than did youths with CP. Similar levels of enjoyment in activity were found in both groups. In some scales of the CAPE, youths with CP participated in proportionally more activities alone and at home. Gender differences and Group x Gender interaction were found in some scales with respect to participation in and enjoyment of activities.

Robotic technology offers the potential to objectively measure complex sensorimotor function but has been understudied in perinatal stroke. The present study aimed to quantify kinesthetic deficits in hemiparetic children with perinatal stroke and determine their association with clinical function.
METHODS: Case-control study. Participants were 6-19 years of age. Stroke participants had MRI confirmed unilateral perinatal arterial ischemic stroke or periventricular venous infarction, and symptomatic hemiparetic cerebral palsy. Participants completed a robotic assessment of upper extremity kinesthesia using a robotic exoskeleton (KINARM). Four kinesthetic parameters (response latency, initial direction error, peak speed ratio, and path length ratio) and their variabilities were measured with and without vision. Robotic outcomes were compared across stroke groups and controls and to clinical measures of sensorimotor function.
RESULTS: Forty-three stroke participants (23 arterial, 20 venous, median age 12 years, 42\% female) were compared to 106 healthy controls. Stroke cases displayed significantly impaired kinesthesia that remained when vision was restored. Kinesthesia was more impaired in arterial versus venous lesions and correlated with clinical measures.
CONCLUSIONS: Robotic assessment of kinesthesia is feasible in children with perinatal stroke. Kinesthetic impairment is common and associated with stroke type. Failure to correct with vision suggests sensory network dysfunction.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Comparison of climbing versus no treatment to treat chronic low back pain.
DESIGN: Prospective randomized controlled trial.
SETTING: Tertiary.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 30 patients with chronic low back pain were recruited and randomly assigned to 2 different groups: climbing and control. The inclusion criteria were defined as chronic low back pain, age between 18 and 45 years, body mass index lower than 25, and no climbing experience.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the climbing group were instructed to climb 5 different climbing routes. A climbing activity of 10 sessions in 8 weeks, at least once a week with a minimum duration of 1 hour, was mandatory.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The participants were examined before (T0) and after therapy (8 weeks, T8) and after another 6 weeks (T14). The outcome was evaluated using Oswestry Disability Index, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Likert scale, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Radiologists evaluating MRI were blinded. The study was performed as a single-center study.
RESULTS: Evaluating the Oswestry Disability Index, a significant difference in the time course between the 2 groups was detected (P = 0.022). Significant improvements comparing climbing and control group were also found when assessing VAS in a minimal finger-floor-distance position (P = 0.048). Patients in the climbing group showed a reduction in size of disc protrusion.
CONCLUSIONS: Climbing may be an effective and low-cost therapy option for people with chronic low back pain.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Low back pain is a very common disease but still a challenge to treat. Therapy strategies vary from conservative ones, pharmacological treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and weak opioids, to invasive treatment with acupuncture, injections, and operative reconstruction. Some can be costly and not without risks. For instance, many people who use NSAIDs are at risk of common side effects such as gastrointestinal complications (irritation, ulcers, and bleeding) that may lead to hospitalization. Climbing could offer reduction of pain and better performance in daily life, because it offers a closed chain muscle training that has the potential to improve posture, perception of the trunk midline, and muscle control. Climbing may also lead to a better adherence to continuing treatment than traditional physical therapy and exercise due to a more exciting aspect of the sports activity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common cause of motor disabilities in children and young adults and it is also often associated with cognitive and physiological challenges. Climbing requires a multifaceted repertoire of movements, participants at all levels of expertise may be challenged functionally and cognitively, making climbing of great potential interest in (re)habilitation settings. However, until now only few research projects have investigated the feasibility of climbing as a potential activity for heightening physical activity in children with CP and the possible beneficial effects of climbing activities in populations with functional and/or cognitive challenges. The aim of this study was therefore to test the feasibility of an intensive 3 weeks indoor-climbing training program in children with CP and typically developing (TD) peers. In addition we evaluated possible functional and cognitive benefits of 3 weeks of intensive climbing training in 11 children with cerebral palsy (CP) aged 11-13 years and six of their TD peers.
METHOD: The study was designed as a feasibility and interventional study. We evaluated the amount of time spent being physically active during the 9 indoor-climbing training sessions, and climbing abilities were measured. The participants were tested in a series of physiological, psychological and cognitive tests: two times prior to and one time following the training in order to explore possible effects of the intervention.
RESULTS: The children accomplished the training goal of a total of nine sessions within the 3-week training period. The time of physical activity during a 2:30 h climbing session, was comparably high in the group of children with CP and the TD children. The children with CP were physically active on average for almost 16 h in total during the 3 weeks. Both groups of participants improved their climbing abilities, the children with CP managed to climb a larger proportion of the tested climbing route at the end of training and the TD group climbed faster. For the children with CP this was accompanied by significant improvements in the Sit-to-stand test (p {\textless} 0.01), increased rate of force development in the least affected hand during an explosive pinch test and increased muscular-muscular coherence during a pinch precision test (p {\textless} 0.05). We found no improvements in maximal hand or finger strength and no changes in cognitive abilities or psychological well-being in any of the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that it is possible to use climbing as means to make children with CP physically active. The improved motor abilities obtained through the training is likely reflected by increased synchronization between cortex and muscles, which results in a more efficient motor unit recruitment that may be transferred to daily functional abilities.

There is limited data regarding the possible effects of sport climbing respectively therapeutic climbing on patients with MS. Sport climbing offers many potentially beneficial effects for patients with MS since there are effects on coordination, muscular strength, and cognition to name the most relevant ones. Also, disease models in rodents point toward such positive outcomes of climbing. Therefore, we assessed the currently available research literature on general effects of physical exercise, impact of climbing on body and mind and therapeutic climbing for prevention or therapy for the treatment of MS. The sparse published controlled trials that investigated this sport activity on different groups of patients with neurological or geriatric diseases grossly differ in study design and outcome parameters. Nevertheless, it appears that climbing offers the opportunity to improve some of the symptoms of patients with MS and can contribute to an enhanced quality of life.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hemianopia is a complete or partial blindness in the visual fields of both eyes, commonly caused by cerebral infarction. It has been hypothesized that systematic audio-visual (AV) stimulation of the blind hemifield can improve accuracy and search times, probably due to the stimulation of bimodal representations in the superior colliculus (SC), an important multisensory structure involved in both the initiation and execution of saccades.
METHODS: A narrative synthesis of the findings is presented to highlight how AV rehabilitation impacts on patients with hemianopia including visual oculomotor function, functional ability in activities of daily living, hemianopic dyslexia, visual scanning and searching tasks, maintaining of functional ability post training and the effect on brain multisensory integration by using neuroimaging.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included (fourteen articles (188 participants) and two literature reviews). Results were grouped into AV training of hemianopia in adults and in children and then further grouped according to the AV task type: tasks measuring the training effects by comparing visual stimulation training to audio-visual training, localization abilities in homonymous hemianopia (HH) and AV integration in patients with HH.
CONCLUSION: Systematic AV training may improve the processing of visual information by recruiting subcortical pathways, and because most of the patients with visual cortex damage have an intact SC, it might be useful to use the bimodal AV training to activate retinotectal functions. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms supporting the reported positive effects are not currently understood. Systematic functional and/or structural imaging studies may help in understanding the underlying mechanism and inform the design of optimal training paradigms.},

Recent studies focusing on the visual system have shown that these effects are associated with the recruitment of previously unsuspected neural plasticity processes. At early stages of brain development, EE triggers a marked acceleration in the maturation of the visual system, with maternal behaviour acting as a fundamental mediator of the enriched experience in both the foetus and the newborn. In adult brain, EE enhances plasticity in the cerebral cortex, allowing the recovery of visual functions in amblyopic animals. The molecular substrate of the effects of EE on brain plasticity is multi-factorial, with reduced intracerebral inhibition, enhanced neurotrophin expression and epigenetic changes at the level of chromatin structure. These findings shed new light on the potential of EE as a non-invasive strategy to ameliorate deficits in the development of the CNS and to treat neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {For reaching and grasping, as well as for manipulating objects, optimal hand motor control arises from the integration of multiple sources of sensory information, such as proprioception and vision. For this reason, proprioceptive deficits often observed in stroke patients have a significant impact on the integrity of motor functions. The present targeted review attempts to reanalyze previous findings about proprioceptive upper-limb deficits in stroke patients, as well as their ability to compensate for these deficits using vision. Our theoretical approach is based on two concepts: first, the description of multi-sensory integration using statistical optimization models; second, on the insight that sensory information is not only encoded in the reference frame of origin (e.g., retinal and joint space for vision and proprioception, respectively), but also in higher-order sensory spaces. Combining these two concepts within a single framework appears to account for the heterogeneity of experimental findings reported in the literature. The present analysis suggests that functional upper limb post-stroke deficits could not only be due to an impairment of the proprioceptive system per se, but also due to deficiencies of cross-references processing; that is of the ability to encode proprioceptive information in a non-joint space. The distinction between purely proprioceptive or cross-reference-related deficits can account for two experimental observations: first, one and the same patient can perform differently depending on specific proprioceptive assessments; and a given behavioral assessment results in large variability across patients. The distinction between sensory and cross-reference deficits is also supported by a targeted literature review on the relation between cerebral structure and proprioceptive function. This theoretical framework has the potential to lead to a new stratification of patients with proprioceptive deficits, and may offer a novel approach to post-stroke rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {For more than 50 years, "Sensory Integration" has been a theoretical framework for diagnosing and treating disabilities in children under the umbrella of "sensory integration dysfunction" (SID). More recently, the approach has been reframed as "the dimensions of sensory processing" or SPD in place of SID, so the review herein describes this collective framework as sensory integration/sensory processing treatment (SI/SP-T) for ASD. This review is not focused on diagnosis of SI/SPD. Broadly, the SI/SPD intervention approach views a plethora of disabilities such as ADHD, ASD, and disruptive behavior as being exacerbated by difficulties in modulating and integrating sensory input with a primary focus on contributions from tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular systems which are hypothesized to contribute to core symptoms of the conditions (e.g., ASD). SI/SP intervention procedures include sensory protocols designed to enhance tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular experiences. SI/SP-T procedures utilize equipment (e.g., lycra swings, balance beams, climbing walls, and trampolines), specific devices (e.g., weighted vests, sensory brushes) and activities (e.g., placing hands in messy substances such as shaving cream, sequenced movements) hypothesized to enhance sensory integration and sensory processing. The approach is reviewed herein to provide a framework for testing SI/SP-T using widely accepted clinical trials and event coding methods used in applied behavior analysis (ABA) and other behavioral interventions. Also, a related but distinct neuroscientific paradigm, multisensory integration, is presented as an independent test of whether SI/SP-T differentially impacts sensory integration and/or multisensory integration. Finally, because SI/SP-T activities include many incidental behavioral events that are known as developmental facilitators (e.g., contingent verbal models/recasts during verbal interactions), there is a compelling need to control for confounds to study the unique impact of sensory-based interventions. Note that SI/SP-T includes very specific and identifiable procedures and materials, so it is reasonable to expect high treatment fidelity when testing the approach. A patient case is presented that illustrates this confound with a known facilitator (recast intervention) and a method for controlling potential confounds in order to conduct unbiased studies of the effects of SI/SP-T approaches that accurately represent SI/SP-T theories of change.},

	abstract = {Stroke causes direct structural damage to local brain networks and indirect functional damage to distant brain regions. Neuroplasticity after stroke involves molecular changes within perilesional tissue that can be influenced by regions functionally connected to the site of injury. Spontaneous functional recovery can be enhanced by rehabilitative strategies, which provides experience-driven cell signaling in the brain that enhances plasticity. Functional neuroimaging in humans and rodents has shown that spontaneous recovery of sensorimotor function after stroke is associated with changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RS-FC) within and across brain networks. At the molecular level, GABAergic inhibitory interneurons can modulate brain plasticity in peri-infarct and remote brain regions. Among this cell-type, a decrease in parvalbumin (PV)-immunoreactivity has been associated with improved behavioral outcome. Subjecting rodents to multisensory stimulation through exposure to an enriched environment (EE) enhances brain plasticity and recovery of function after stroke. Yet, how multisensory stimulation relates to RS-FC has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the effect of EE on recovery of RS-FC and behavior in mice after stroke, and if EE-related changes in RS-FC were associated with levels of PV-expressing neurons. Photothrombotic stroke was induced in the sensorimotor cortex. Beginning 2 days after stroke, mice were housed in either standard environment (STD) or EE for 12 days. Housing in EE significantly improved lost tactile-proprioceptive function compared to mice housed in STD environment. RS-FC in the mouse was measured by optical intrinsic signal imaging 14 days after stroke or sham surgery. Stroke induced a marked reduction in RS-FC within several perilesional and remote brain regions. EE partially restored interhemispheric homotopic RS-FC between spared motor regions, particularly posterior secondary motor. Compared to mice housed in STD cages, EE exposure lead to increased RS-FC between posterior secondary motor regions and contralesional posterior parietal and retrosplenial regions. The increased regional RS-FC observed in EE mice after stroke was significantly correlated with decreased PV-immunoreactivity in the contralesional posterior motor region. In conclusion, experimental stroke and subsequent housing in EE induces dynamic changes in RS-FC in the mouse brain. Multisensory stimulation associated with EE enhances RS-FC among distinct brain regions relevant for recovery of sensorimotor function and controlled movements that may involve PV/GABA interneurons. Our results indicate that targeting neural circuitry involving spared motor regions across hemispheres by neuromodulation and multimodal sensory stimulation could improve rehabilitation after stroke.},

Both types of feedback relied on the BCI classification result achieved using common spatial patterns and a linear discriminant analysis classifier. After 10 sessions of recoveriX training, one patient partially regained control of wrist extension in her paretic wrist and the other patient increased the range of middle finger movement by 1 cm. A controlled group study is planned with a new version of the recoveriX system, which will have several improvements.},

	abstract = {What are the principles underlying effective neurorehabilitation? The aim of neurorehabilitation is to exploit interventions based on human and animal studies about learning and adaptation, as well as to show that the activation of experience-dependent neuronal plasticity augments functional recovery after stroke. Instead of teaching compensatory strategies that do not reduce impairment but allow the patient to return home as soon as possible, functional recovery might be more sustainable as it ensures a long-term reduction in impairment and an improvement in quality of life. At the same time, neurorehabilitation permits the scientific community to collect valuable data, which allows inferring about the principles of brain organization. Hence neuroscience sheds light on the mechanisms of learning new functions or relearning lost ones. However, current rehabilitation methods lack the exact operationalization of evidence gained from skill learning literature, leading to an urgent need to bridge motor learning theory and present clinical work in order to identify a set of ingredients and practical applications that could guide future interventions. This work aims to unify the neuroscientific literature relevant to the recovery process and rehabilitation practice in order to provide a synthesis of the principles that constitute an effective neurorehabilitation approach. Previous attempts to achieve this goal either focused on a subset of principles or did not link clinical application to the principles of motor learning and recovery. We identified 15 principles of motor learning based on existing literature: massed practice, spaced practice, dosage, task-specific practice, goal-oriented practice, variable practice, increasing difficulty, multisensory stimulation, rhythmic cueing, explicit feedback/knowledge of results, implicit feedback/knowledge of performance, modulate effector selection, action observation/embodied practice, motor imagery, and social interaction. We comment on trials that successfully implemented these principles and report evidence from experiments with healthy individuals as well as clinical work.},

Despite several evidences have highlighted the need for an early introduction of re-habilitation interventions, such interventions are rarely adapted to children's visual capabilities and very few studies have been conducted to assess their long-term efficacy. In this work, we present a case study of a visually impaired child enrolled in a newly developed re-habilitation intervention aimed at improving the overall development through the diversification of re-habilitation activities based on visual potential and developmental profile, with a focus on spatial functioning. We argue that intervention for visually impaired children should be (a) adapted to their visual capabilities, in order to increase re-habilitation outcomes, (b) multi-interdisciplinary and multidimensional, to improve adaptive abilities across development, (c) multisensory, to promote the integration of different perceptual information coming from the environment.},

	abstract = {AIM: To systematically review the evidence on the effectiveness of motor interventions for infants from birth to 2 years with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy or at high risk of it.
METHOD: Relevant literature was identified by searching journal article databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, Web of Knowledge, and PEDro). Selection criteria included infants between the ages of birth and 2 years diagnosed with, or at risk of, cerebral palsy who received early motor intervention.
RESULTS: Thirty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, including 10 randomized controlled trials. Studies varied in quality, interventions, and participant inclusion criteria. Neurodevelopmental therapy was the most common intervention investigated either as the experimental or control assignment. The two interventions that had a moderate to large effect on motor outcomes (Cohen's effect size{\textgreater}0.7) had the common themes of child-initiated movement, environment modification/enrichment, and task-specific training.
INTERPRETATION: The published evidence for early motor intervention is limited by the lack of high-quality trials. There is some promising evidence that early intervention incorporating child-initiated movement (based on motor-learning principles and task specificity), parental education, and environment modification have a positive effect on motor development. Further research is crucial.},

	abstract = {Post-stroke neuroplasticity and cognitive recovery can be enhanced by multimodal stimulation via environmental enrichment. In this vein, recent studies have shown that enriched sound environment (i.e., listening to music) during the subacute post-stroke stage improves cognitive outcomes compared to standard care. The beneficial effects of post-stroke music listening are further pronounced when listening to music containing singing, which enhances language recovery coupled with structural and functional connectivity changes within the language network. However, outside the language network, virtually nothing is known about the effects of enriched sound environment on the structural connectome of the recovering post-stroke brain. Here, we report secondary outcomes from a single-blind randomized controlled trial (NCT01749709) in patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke (N = 38) who were randomly assigned to listen to vocal music, instrumental music, or audiobooks during the first 3 post-stroke months. Utilizing the longitudinal diffusion-weighted MRI data of the trial, the present study aimed to determine whether the music listening interventions induce changes on structural white matter connectome compared to the control audiobook intervention. Both vocal and instrumental music groups increased quantitative anisotropy longitudinally in multiple left dorsal and ventral tracts as well as in the corpus callosum, and also in the right hemisphere compared to the audiobook group. Audiobook group did not show increased structural connectivity changes compared to both vocal and instrumental music groups. This study shows that listening to music, either vocal or instrumental promotes wide-spread structural connectivity changes in the post-stroke brain, providing a fertile ground for functional restoration.},

Evidence was considered with a focus on low-level, perceptual (visual, auditory and somatosensory deficits), as well as higher-level, cognitive, sensory deficits. We referred to the electronic databases Scopus and PubMed to search for articles that were published before May 2015. Studies were included which evaluated the effects of multisensory stimulation on patients with low- or higher-level sensory deficits caused by stroke. Twenty-one studies were included in this review and the quality of these studies was assessed (based on eight elements: randomization, inclusion of control patient group, blinding of participants, blinding of researchers, follow-up, group size, reporting effect sizes, and reporting time post-stroke). Twenty of the twenty-one included studies demonstrate beneficial effects on low- and/or higher-level sensory deficits after stroke. Notwithstanding these beneficial effects, the quality of the studies is insufficient for valid conclusion that multisensory stimulation can be successfully applied as an effective intervention. A valuable and necessary next step would be to set up well-designed randomized controlled trials to examine the effectiveness of multisensory stimulation as an intervention for low- and/or higher-level sensory deficits after stroke. Finally, we consider the potential mechanisms of multisensory stimulation for rehabilitation to guide this future research.},

	abstract = {The integration of information from multiple senses leads to a plethora of behavioral benefits, most predominantly to faster and better detection, localization, and identification of events in the environment. Although previous studies of multisensory integration (MSI) in humans have provided insights into the neural underpinnings of MSI, studies of MSI at a behavioral level in individuals with brain damage are scarce. Here, a well-known psychophysical paradigm (the redundant target paradigm) was employed to quantify MSI in a group of stroke patients. The relation between MSI and lesion location was analyzed using lesion subtraction analysis. Twenty-one patients with ischemic infarctions and 14 healthy control participants responded to auditory, visual, and audiovisual targets in the left and right visual hemifield. Responses to audiovisual targets were faster than to unisensory targets. This could be due to MSI or statistical facilitation. Comparing the audiovisual RTs to the winner of a race between unisensory signals allowed us to determine whether participants could integrate auditory and visual information. The results indicated that (1) 33\% of the patients showed an impairment in MSI; (2) patients with MSI impairment had left hemisphere and brainstem/cerebellar lesions; and (3) the left caudate, left pallidum, left putamen, left thalamus, left insula, left postcentral and precentral gyrus, left central opercular cortex, left amygdala, and left OFC were more often damaged in patients with MSI impairments. These results are the first to demonstrate the impact of brain damage on MSI in stroke patients using a well-established psychophysical paradigm.},

It is unknown whether poststroke upper-limb motor and somatosensory impairment both reflect spontaneous neurobiological recovery or if somatosensory impairment and/or recovery influences motor recovery. Methods. Motor (Fugl-Meyer upper-extremity [FM-UE]) and somatosensory impairments (Erasmus modification of the Nottingham Sensory Assessment [EmNSA-UE]) were measured in 215 patients within 3 weeks and at 5, 12, and 26 weeks after a first-ever ischemic stroke. The longitudinal association between FM-UE and EmNSA-UE was examined in patients with motor and somatosensory impairments (FM-UE ≤ 60 and EmNSA-UE ≤ 37) at baseline. Results. A total of 94 patients were included in the longitudinal analysis. EmNSA-UE increased significantly up to 12 weeks poststroke. The longitudinal association between motor and somatosensory impairment disappeared when correcting for progress of time and was not significantly different for patients with severe baseline somatosensory impairment. Patients with a FM-UE score ≥18 at 26 weeks (n = 55) showed a significant positive association between motor and somatosensory impairments, irrespective of progress of time. Conclusions. Progress of time, as a reflection of spontaneous neurobiological recovery, is an important factor that drives recovery of upper-limb motor as well as somatosensory impairments in the first 12 weeks poststroke. Severe somatosensory impairment at baseline does not directly compromise motor recovery. The study rather suggests that spontaneous recovery of somatosensory impairment is a prerequisite for full motor recovery of the upper paretic limb.},

However, it is not known whether combined upper and lower extremity training in an intensive protocol is more efficacious for upper and lower functional abilities than conventional therapies provided in usual customary care. Objective. To determine the efficacy of Hand and Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy Including Lower Extremity (HABIT-ILE) for children with USCP. Methods. Twenty-four children with USCP were randomized into 2 groups: an immediate HABIT-ILE group (IHG, initially receiving HABIT-ILE, 10 days = 90 hours), and a delayed HABIT-ILE group (DHG), which continued their conventional/ongoing treatment for an intended total duration of 90 hours. In phase 2, children in the DHG were crossed over to receive HABIT-ILE and children of the IHG were followed in their ongoing conventional therapy. Children were assessed using the Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA, primary outcome), the ABILHAND-Kids, and the Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory. Dexterity (Box and Blocks Test [BBT]) and pinch strength were also measured. Locomotor abilities were assessed with Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT, primary outcome) and ABILOCO-kids. Social participation was measured with the Assessment of Life-HABITs. Results. A 2 (groups) × 3 (test sessions) analysis of variance indicated significant improvements for primary outcomes (AHA, P {\textless} .001; 6MWT, P = .002) and all secondary assessments except BBT, step length and bodyweight distribution following HABIT-ILE, but not conventional therapy. Conclusion. The findings suggest that combined upper and lower extremity in an intensive training protocol may be efficacious for improving both upper and lower extremity function in children with USCP.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Background
            Perinatal stroke injures motor regions of the brain, compromising movement for life. Early, intensive, active interventions for the upper extremity are efficacious, but interventions for the lower extremity (LE) remain infrequent and understudied.
          
          
            Objective
            To determine the efficacy of ELEVATE – Engaging the Lower Extremity Via Active Therapy Early - on gross motor function, as compared to usual care.
          
          
            Method
            We conducted a single-blind, two-arm, randomized controlled trial (RCT), with the Immediate Group receiving the intervention while the Delay Group served as a three-month waitlist-control. A separate cohort living beyond commuting distance was trained by their parents with guidance from physical therapists. Participants were 8 months to 3 years old, with MRI-confirmed perinatal ischemic stroke and early signs of hemiparesis. The intervention was play-based, focused on weight-bearing, balance and walking for 1 hour/day, 4 days/week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66). Secondary outcomes included steps and gait analyses. Final follow-up occurred at age four.
          
          
            Results
            Thirty-four children participated (25 RCT, 9 Parent-trained). The improvement in GMFM-66 over 12 weeks was greater for the Immediate than the Delay Group (average change 3.4 units higher) and greater in younger children. Average step counts reached 1370–3750 steps/session in the last week of training for all children. Parent-trained children also improved but with greater variability.
          
          
            Conclusions
            Early, activity-intensive LE therapy for young children with perinatal stroke is feasible and improves gross motor function in the short term. Longer term improvement may require additional bouts of intervention.

	abstract = {Objective. Constraint-Induced Movement (CI) therapy has been found to be a promising treatment for substantially increasing the use of extremities affected by such neurologic injuries as stroke and traumatic brain injury in adults. The purpose of this study was to determine the applicability of this intervention to young children with cerebral palsy.
            Methods. A randomized, controlled clinical trial of pediatric CI therapy in which 18 children with diagnosed hemiparesis associated with cerebral palsy (7–96 months old) were randomly assigned to receive either pediatric CI therapy or conventional treatment. Pediatric CI therapy involved promoting increased use of the more-affected arm and hand by intensive training (using shaping) of the more-impaired upper extremity for 6 hours/day for 21 consecutive days coupled with bivalved casting of the child’s less-affected upper extremity for that period. Children’s functional upper-extremity skills were assessed in the laboratory (blinded scoring) and at home (parent ratings) just prior, after, and 3 weeks posttreatment. Treated children were followed for 6 months.
            Results. Children receiving pediatric CI therapy compared with controls acquired significantly more new classes of motoric skills (9.3 vs 2.2); demonstrated significant gains in the mean amount (2.1 vs 0.1) and quality (1.7 vs 0.3) of more-affected arm use at home; and in a laboratory motor function test displayed substantial improvement including increases in unprompted use of the more-affected upper extremity (52.1\% vs 2.1\% of items). Benefits were maintained over 6 months, with supplemental evidence of quality-of-life changes for many children.
            Conclusion. Pediatric CI therapy produced major and sustained improvement in motoric function in the young children with hemiparesis in the study.},

              . To investigate whether long-term climbing training improves motor function in patients with cerebellar ataxia.
              Methods
              . Four patients suffering from limb and gait ataxia underwent a 6-week climbing training. Its effect on ataxia was evaluated with validated clinical balance and manual dexterity tests and with a kinematic analysis of multijoint arm and leg pointing movements.
              Results
              . The patients increased their movement velocity and achieved a more symmetric movement speed profile in both arm and leg pointing movements. Furthermore, the 2 patients who suffered the most from gait ataxia improved their balance and 2 of the 4 patients improved manual dexterity.

              The aim of this guideline is to provide a synopsis of best clinical practices in the rehabilitative care of adults recovering from stroke.
            
            
              Methods—
              Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association (AHA) Stroke Council’s Scientific Statement Oversight Committee and the AHA’s Manuscript Oversight Committee. The panel reviewed relevant articles on adults using computerized searches of the medical literature through 2014. The evidence is organized within the context of the AHA framework and is classified according to the joint AHA/American College of Cardiology and supplementary AHA methods of classifying the level of certainty and the class and level of evidence. The document underwent extensive AHA internal and external peer review, Stroke Council Leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before consideration and approval by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.
            
            
              Results—
              Stroke rehabilitation requires a sustained and coordinated effort from a large team, including the patient and his or her goals, family and friends, other caregivers (eg, personal care attendants), physicians, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, recreation therapists, psychologists, nutritionists, social workers, and others. Communication and coordination among these team members are paramount in maximizing the effectiveness and efficiency of rehabilitation and underlie this entire guideline. Without communication and coordination, isolated efforts to rehabilitate the stroke survivor are unlikely to achieve their full potential.
            
            
              Conclusions—
              
                As systems of care evolve in response to healthcare reform efforts, postacute care and rehabilitation are often considered a costly area of care to be trimmed but without recognition of their clinical impact and ability to reduce the risk of downstream medical morbidity resulting from immobility, depression, loss of autonomy, and reduced functional independence. The provision of comprehensive rehabilitation programs with adequate resources, dose, and duration is an essential aspect of stroke care and should be a priority in these redesign efforts. (

	abstract = {Background. Spontaneous recovery early after stroke is most evident during a time-sensitive window of heightened neuroplasticity, known as spontaneous neurobiological recovery. It is unknown whether poststroke upper-limb motor and somatosensory impairment both reflect spontaneous neurobiological recovery or if somatosensory impairment and/or recovery influences motor recovery. Methods. Motor (Fugl-Meyer upper-extremity [FM-UE]) and somatosensory impairments (Erasmus modification of the Nottingham Sensory Assessment [EmNSA-UE]) were measured in 215 patients within 3 weeks and at 5, 12, and 26 weeks after a first-ever ischemic stroke. The longitudinal association between FM-UE and EmNSA-UE was examined in patients with motor and somatosensory impairments (FM-UE ≤ 60 and EmNSA-UE ≤ 37) at baseline. Results. A total of 94 patients were included in the longitudinal analysis. EmNSA-UE increased significantly up to 12 weeks poststroke. The longitudinal association between motor and somatosensory impairment disappeared when correcting for progress of time and was not significantly different for patients with severe baseline somatosensory impairment. Patients with a FM-UE score ≥18 at 26 weeks (n = 55) showed a significant positive association between motor and somatosensory impairments, irrespective of progress of time. Conclusions. Progress of time, as a reflection of spontaneous neurobiological recovery, is an important factor that drives recovery of upper-limb motor as well as somatosensory impairments in the first 12 weeks poststroke. Severe somatosensory impairment at baseline does not directly compromise motor recovery. The study rather suggests that spontaneous recovery of somatosensory impairment is a prerequisite for full motor recovery of the upper paretic limb.},

Behavioral researchers have long reported that children with CP exhibit suboptimal performance in different cognitive domains (e.g., receptive and expressive language skills, reading, mental imagery, spatial processing, subitizing, math, and executive functions). However, there has been very limited cross-domain research involving these two areas of scientific inquiry. To stimulate such research, this perspective paper proposes some possible neurological mechanisms involved in the cognitive delays and impairments in children with CP. Additionally, the paper examines the ways motor and sensorimotor experience during the development of these neural substrates could enable more optimal development for children with CP. Understanding these developmental mechanisms could guide more effective interventions to promote the development of both sensorimotor and cognitive skills in children with CP.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.12.001},
	abstract = {Background
Many forms of home-based technology targeting stroke rehabilitation have been devised, and a number of human factors are important to their application, suggesting the need to examine this information in a comprehensive review.
Objective
The systematic review aims to synthesize the current knowledge of technologies and human factors in home-based technologies for stroke rehabilitation.
Methods
We conducted a systematic literature search in three electronic databases (IEEE, ACM, PubMed), including secondary citations from the literature search. We included articles that used technological means to help stroke patients conduct rehabilitation at home, reported empirical studies that evaluated the technologies with patients in the home environment, and were published in English. Three authors independently conducted the content analysis of searched articles using a list of interactively defined factors.
Results
The search yielded 832 potentially relevant articles, leading to 31 articles that were included for in-depth analysis. The types of technology of reviewed articles included games, telerehabilitation, robotic devices, virtual reality devices, sensors, and tablets. We present the merits and limitations of each type of technology. We then derive two main human factors in designing home-based technologies for stroke rehabilitation: designing for engagement (including external and internal motivation) and designing for the home environment (including understanding the social context, practical challenges, and technical proficiency).
Conclusion
This systematic review presents an overview of key technologies and human factors for designing home-based technologies for stroke rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {During the first years of life, sensory modalities communicate with each other. This process is fundamental for the development of unisensory and multisensory skills. The absence of one sensory input impacts on the development of other modalities. Since 2008 we have studied these aspects and developed our cross-sensory calibration theory. This theory emerged from the observation that children start to integrate multisensory information (such as vision and touch) only after 8–10 years of age. Before this age the more accurate sense teaches (calibrates) the others; when one calibrating modality is missing, the other modalities result impaired. Children with visual disability have problems in understanding the haptic or auditory perception of space and children with motor disabilities have problems in understanding the visual dimension of objects. This review presents our recent studies on multisensory integration and cross-sensory calibration in children and adults with and without sensory and motor disabilities. The goal of this review is to show the importance of interaction between sensory systems during the early period of life in order to correct perceptual development to occur.},

The bracelet is worn on the wrist and the key feature is to provide an audio feedback about body movements to help visually impaired children to build a sense of space. Nine early blind children took part at this study. The study lasted 12 weeks. Once per week each child participated in a 45-minutes ABBI rehabilitation with trained professionals. He also had to use it one hour per day at home alone or with one relative. The mobility and spatial cognition abilities were measured before and after a 12-weeks rehabilitation program with three different tests. Results showed that the use of the Audio Bracelet for Blind Interaction allowed the early blind children to significantly improve their mobility and spatial abilities. Although an extended study including a larger number of participants is needed to confirm these data, the present results are encouraging. They do suggest that ABBI could be used for rehabilitate the sense of space in visually impaired children.},

In addition, given the modularity of the architecture and the simple mechanism to attach/detach the contact modules, this structure can be easily modified in order to analyze different multi-finger grasp configurations. The effectiveness of this device was experimentally demonstrated and applications to neuroscientific studies and state of the art of devices for similar investigations are discussed in depth within the text.},

In this paper, we describe an initial experiment that measured how well blindfolded sighted individuals could track a moving sound source in 2D horizontal space and then walk the same route to the same end position. Six sounds, including natural sounds, abstract sounds, Earcons and speech, were compared to identify which type of sound produced more accurate route recreation},

While several attempts have been made to use low-cost motion tracking devices (Kinect) or balance boards (Wii Board), the potential of low-cost haptic devices has yet to be explored in this context. The objective of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to influence postural stability with a low-cost device despite its technical limitations, and to explore the most promising modes of haptic interaction to increase and decrease postural stability. Two groups of younger subjects used a high-end (Omega.3) and a low-cost (Falcon) device respectively. A third group of older subjects used the Falcon. We show that light touch contact with the device improves stability, whereas the force tasks decrease it. The effects of the different tasks are consistent in the two age groups. Although there are differences in the participants' interaction with the two devices, the effect of the devices on postural stability is comparable. We conclude that a low-cost haptic device can be used to increase or decrease postural stability of healthy subjects with an age similar to that of typical stroke patients, in a safe and controllable way.},

	abstract = {In the present paper, we focus on neuronal changes that occur in response to complex stimulation by an enriched environment. An enriched environment is 'enriched' in relation to standard laboratory housing conditions. In general the 'enriched' animals are kept in larger cages and in larger groups with tunnels, nesting material and toys.Exposure to an enriched environment has been found to elicit neuroanatomical and behavioural changes, such as enhanced dendritic arborization, gliogenesis, neurogenesis, and improved learning.It is difficult to isolate the behavioural factors that are responsible for neural changes. Factors such as social interaction, learning and motor activity have been suggested to mediate neural consequences of the enriched environment.Similar to the effects of environmental enrichment, voluntary exercise in a running wheel enhances the survival of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus. In addition, both conditions improve learning and memory. Therefore effects of enrichment and exercise on behavioural, morphological and molecular changes in the brain are compared in the review.Enrichment increases dendritic branching and synaptogenesis in cortex and hippocampus. It is not known if exercise results in similar changes.Exercise enhances dentate gyrus long-term potentiation. Enrichment increases excitatory postsynaptic potential slopes in the dentate gyrus.Both exercise and enrichment enhance production of certain growth factors and neurotransmitters in the hippocampus.Two areas of neurobiological research that may benefit from use of the environmental enrichment and exercise models are mouse genetics and studies of recovery of function following brain and spinal injury or disease. For example, enrichment has been shown to enhance function in mice that have been engineered to overexpress Huntington's disease gene products. In addition, enrichment as well as exercise seem to be beneficial for conditions such as stroke and epilepsy.},

To review general principles of brain development, identify basic principles of brain plasticity, and discuss factors that influence brain development and plasticity.

Method:
A literature review of relevant English-language manuscripts on brain development and plasticity was conducted.

Results:
Brain development progresses through a series of stages beginning with neurogenesis and progressing to neural migration, maturation, synaptogenesis, pruning, and myelin formation. Eight basic principles of brain plasticity are identified. Evidence that brain development and function is influenced by different environmental events such as sensory stimuli, psychoactive drugs, gonadal hormones, parental-child relationships, peer relationships, early stress, intestinal flora, and diet.

Conclusions:
The development of the brain reflects more than the simple unfolding of a genetic blueprint but rather reflects a complex dance of genetic and experiential factors that shape the emerging brain. Understanding the dance provides insight into both normal and abnormal development.},

However, it is still unknown if motor impairment affects the building of simple spatial perception. To investigate this point, we tested hemiplegic children with (HV) and without visual field (H) disorders in an auditory and visual-spatial localization and pitch discrimination task. Fifteen hemiplegic children (nine H and six HV) and twenty with typical development took part in the experiment. The tasks consisted in listening to a sound coming from a series of speakers positioned at the front or back of the subject. In one condition, subjects were asked to discriminate the pitch, while in the other, subjects had to localize the position of the sound. We also replicated the spatial task in a visual modality. Both groups of hemiplegic children performed worse in the auditory spatial localization task compared with the control, while no difference was found in the pitch discrimination task. For the visual-spatial localization task, only HV children differed from the two other groups. These results suggest that movement is important for the development of auditory spatial representation.},

Consequently, blindness in children affects the development of their spatial abilities. Here we present ABBI (Audio Bracelet for Blind Interaction), a wearable device that was developed to rehabilitate underdeveloped skills in visually impaired children. The core idea behind ABBI is to use the auditory modality to convey spatial information about the movement of the person's own body within the personal, peri-personal and extra-personal space. Specifically, it provides sources of sounds positioned on the main effectors/limbs (such as the wrists and feet) of persons with visual deficits. The ABBI system is composed of a small wearable custom-designed device with integrated audio system, motion sensors, and a Bluetooth low energy module to communicate with a smartphone. We discuss the importance of this device in terms of innovation, usability and highlight future studies aimed at rehabilitating the brain processes and functions involved in spatial cognition of children with visual disabilities through natural audio-motor associations.},

	abstract = {It has been hypothesized that crossmodal recalibration plays a crucial role for the development of multisensory integration capabilities [1]. To test the developmental trajectory of multisensory integration and crossmodal recalibration, we used a combined ventriloquist/ventriloquist aftereffect paradigm [2] in children aged 5-9 years. The ventriloquist effect (indicating multisensory integration), that is, the shift of auditory localization toward simultaneously presented but spatially discrepant visual stimuli, was larger in children than in adults, which was attributed to a lower auditory localization precision in the children. In fact, the size of the ventriloquist effect depended on the visual stimulus reliability in both children and adults. In all groups, the ventriloquist effect was best explained by a causal inference model. In contrast to their multisensory integration capabilities, 5-year-old children did not recalibrate. The immediate ventriloquist aftereffect (indicating recalibration after a single exposure to a spatially discrepant audio-visual stimulus) emerged in 6- to 7-year-old children, whereas the cumulative ventriloquist aftereffect (reflecting recalibration to the audio-visual spatial discrepancies over the complete experiment) was not observed before the age of 8 years. First, in contrast to common beliefs, the present results provide evidence that multisensory integration precedes rather than follows crossmodal recalibration during development. Second, we report developmental evidence for a dissociation of the processes involved in multisensory integration and immediate as well as cumulative recalibration. We speculate that multisensory integration is a prerequisite for crossmodal recalibration, because the multisensory percept, rather than unimodal cues, might comprise a crucial signal for the calibration of the sensory systems.},
